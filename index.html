	<p>  Drawing has been my passion for as long as I can remember. Recently, near the end of last year, I was inspired by the Animator/Youtuber Telepurte. They did a project where they created an nimation everyday! So, I decided to start making/drawing sketches everyday <a href="https://www.instagram.com/golden._slayer/"target="_blank"> myself :^)</a>
	<br>
	<br>
	It was easy when I first started beacause I had so many ideas and wanted to practice certain styles and techniques when drawing. However, as the days past by, I started running out of things to draw and brainstorming was what I had to do to get something worth drawing. I could easily draw a star, moon, house, cat, dog, table, etc. But drawing something so simple would only take 10-15 mins, but even worse is that I wouldn't be practicing anything worthwhile if I drew someting so simple. If I wanted to practice drawing hands, then a hand holding a pencil would be a great idea. . . . but it would still be extremely simple and I wouldn't gain anything from it. Then, I called upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO2VLJNPABLgT5Ym4nmtB_Q"target="_blank"> terA </a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/briancadivine08/"target="_blank"> Guessing Panda </a> (My brother and sister), to help me come up with amazing ideas and I get to share my pictures and ideas with them to improve and reshape my drawings.

	Now, time for my. . . . .  <a href= "https://cod.tracker.gg/modern-warfare/profile/psn/Golden1slayer/mp"target="_blank"> reckoning </a>
	<br>
	I make these streamers and pro players look like they just got their PS5 for Christmas lol. Let me paint you a picture really fast to describe my game plan. Lets say its Euphrates Bridge right, and we are on the bus side. You are probably one of two types of players, the one who runs straight for the bridge to get your head taken off by the 12 yr old who just found out you can play cod with one hand. . . . or you ARE that 12 yr old. Nothing wrong with the average playstyle but that is exactly my problem with it, its AVERAGE. Being average might be cool for you and your little gamer pals, but I refuse to swim in mediocrity. The only COD Youtubers I respect are <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/@TheseKnivesOnly" target="_blank"> TKO.</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhosImmortal"target="_blank">WhosImmortal </a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheXclusiveAce"target="_blank"> TheXclusiveAce</a>. 
	I'm not going to elaborate on what TKO is for, if you are a true cod fan you should have that tid bit of knowledge already.

	I run in, not guns blazing but not super sneaky either. Its an art that has taken years to perfect but has done me well.<img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/QUXYcgCwvCm4cKcrI3/giphy.gif"width="100" height="100"> "If YoU aReN't BeInG sNeAkY, tHeN wHy RuN gHoSt" <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/QUXYcgCwvCm4cKcrI3/giphy.gif"width="100" height="100">. Because your father is running ghost and I'm about to send you to him if keep talkin all that shit. Taking the obvious route to the opposing team is a death sentence and 95% of the time you can assume death . . . . . .but I happen to be that 5%. I destroy all shred of evidence by running tracker and ghost with a suppressed pistol, only way they can get my location is by either WATCHING me shove my pistol down their ally's throat or call outs with their mics. I run pistols because are they are fun, there is no argument or disagreements. <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/896/756/7de.jpg" target="_blank"> stfu </a> . . . . . Of course every thing has its downsides and in the 1st Modern Warfare, the pistols had a cap on how fast you could shoot them. Before you raise those eyebrows like your terrible imitation of the rock <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/40/19/2e/40192e640b63fc6ccaf74a472970dad4.jpg" width="75"height="75"></a>, I do not use the god awful controller modification to shoot semi guns faster. While my brother uses a scuff controller(he doesn't use the fast trigger either), he will never persuade me to use a <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ds52DrZV4AAF06n.jpg"target="_blank"> scuffy. </a>

	The <a href="https://www.gamesatlas.com/images/cod-modern-warfare/weapons/blueprints/No-Love-Lost.jpg" target="_blank"> X16 </a> and <a href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1662358552795722725/28DA8792A133CE370A761E91094CA37D0CE9248A/?imw=637&imh=358&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=true"target="_blank"> M19</a> were my top two favorites in MW but now we have a new playground to torment the COD sweats. MW2 has the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NZiyd4XpmBA/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank"> P890 </a> and <a href="https://cdn.realsport101.com/images/ncavvykf/gfinityesports/e468839f69854fa878c3e0261489ee1861051202-1920x1080.jpg?rect=1,0,1919,1080&w=700&h=394&dpr=2" target="_blank"> X12 </a>, which are excellent for causing the sweats to evaporate and giving the tryhards enough anger to not need the G-Fuel. The Ghost, along with The Unseen, are my two favorite operators. <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5_MWr9ZFYa0/maxresdefault.jpg"width="175"height="175">
